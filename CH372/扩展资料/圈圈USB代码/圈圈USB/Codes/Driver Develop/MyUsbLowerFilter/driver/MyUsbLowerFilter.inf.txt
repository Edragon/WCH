; It is not a complete .inf file.  It lists sections of a .inf file that need to be
; added to a WDM function driver's .inf file to have a filter driver loaded
; for the WDM device for Windows 9x and Windows 2000/XP.  It can be used as an upper 
; or lower filter.

;   This section is for installing PnP filter drivers under Windows 98.  
;   This will add values to the hardware registry key of the device located
;   at HKLM\Enum\WDM\PNP_ID\DeviceInstanceID
;
;   Note:  replace 'WDM' with bustype;  For instance, USB.
;
;   "LowerFilters" and "UpperFilters" are special values that indicate to
;   the operating system that filter drivers should be loaded along with the
;   function driver and that control the load order of the drivers.  MyUsbLowerFilter driver specified
;   with "LowerFilters" will be loaded before the function driver and its
;   AddDevice routine will be called before the function driver's.  MyUsbLowerFilter driver
;   specified with "UpperFilters" will be loaded after the function driver's
;   and its AddDevice routine will be called after the function driver's.
;
;   This .inf file will use the MyUsbLowerFilter sample as a lower filter.  To use it as
;   an upper filter, use the commented out directive.
